                <p class="card-text">This one is definitely more challenging between the 155 line Java solution in the
                  book, and my coming in not even understanding the problem that a circular buffer solves, let alone how
                  to implement one! I am finding this to be a very valuable approach to studying this book. Focusing on
                  deeply understanding one a day, and skipping to the next section every day, is really allowing me the
                  time to do dives into things that come up like circular buffers.</p>
                <p class="card-text">A problem that can arise with a queue, is that elements are constantly being added
                  and consumed, which requires some sort of updating. One way to deal with this is to use something like
                  a linked list, where each element can carry a reference to its neighbours in the queues regardless of
                  where they are in memory. Another way is to handle the issue, if you are using a fixed size array,
                  then even if you are within your bounds, you have to update every element's position in the array
                  every time you pop or push, which isn't very efficient. Alternatively you can use a circular queue :)
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">It's pretty simple once you understand it. Instead of shifting every element's
                  position in the array when you pop or push, you instead just update what shall be considered the head
                  down the array, and allow the tail to overflow into the space at the beginning of the array, which has
                  now been made possible by the 'head' moving down the array. In the image below, consider 'read' the
                  head, and 'write' the tail.</p>
